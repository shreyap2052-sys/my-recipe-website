<li><h3>Aloo Tikki Chaat</h3></li>
<h3 id="Take a look at the Chaat"></h3>
<img src="https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/betterbutterbucket-silver/shaheen-ali145560707456c2cd22cabb1.jpeg" width = "250px" height="250">
<p>Aloo Tikki Chaat is the ultimate "heartbeat" of Indian street food.
In a nutshell, it is a savoury potato snack consisting of crispy, spiced patties (tikkis) served with
 a variety of toppings that hit every taste bud at once: sweet, spicy, tangy, and salty.</p>
<p>Here's How to Make It :- </p>
<ol>
    <li>Prep the Tikki: Mix boiled, mashed potatoes with cornflour (for binding), red chilli powder, and salt. Shape into patties and shallow-fry on a tawa until golden-brown and extra crisp.
    </li><br>

    <li>Prepare Chole: Use leftover chickpea curry or quickly sauté boiled chickpeas with chole masala, amchur (mango powder), and ginger. Keep it "saucy" rather than dry.</li><br>
    <li>The Base Assembly: Place two hot tikkis on a plate and slightly crush them to let the flavors soak in. Ladle a generous amount of hot chole over them.</li><br>
    <li>The Toppings: Pour fresh, whisked yogurt (dahi), spicy green mint chutney, and sweet-tangy tamarind chutney.</li><br>
    <li>Final Garnish: Sprinkle chaat masala, roasted cumin powder, and a handful of fine sev. Add chopped onions, coriander, and pomegranate seeds for a final pop of color. </li>

<p>Indulge in a trio of decadent "Sweet Delight" treats, starting with brownies, which offer a rich, dense chocolate experience that strikes a perfect balance between a chewy cookie and a soft cake, often featuring a glossy crust and optional add-ins like nuts or chocolate chips. For a more dramatic dessert, the Choco Lava cake—also known as a molten chocolate cake—consists of a delicate, warm cake exterior that, when cut, releases a luscious liquid chocolate center that flows like lava. Completing this indulgent selection are donut cakes, a delightful mashup featuring the moist, tender crumb of a classic cake in the iconic ring shape of a donut, typically finished with a sweet glaze, creamy frosting, or even a rich chocolate cream filling. </p>
